	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

0.02  Fri Oct 22 15:31:45 1999
	- bugfix for uppercase usage for ACINX types

0.03  Fri Oct 22 17:50:12 1999
	- bugfix for $/, uppercase usage for ACINX types

0.04  Thu Oct 28 06:40:45 EDT 1999
	- addition of f/F type; change from Term::Size to
	  Term::ReadKey's GetTerminalSize (more portable and
	  doesn't have to be a glob fed to it)

0.05  Wed Nov 10 13:21:03 EST 1999
	- Missing right bracket restored... my thanks to
	  schinder@pobox.com. I have no idea how I didn't load in 0.04 
	  here and spot the problem...

0.06  Tue Nov 30 18:55:24 EST 1999
	- termwrap made EXPORT_OK, description added to manpage. Bug in
	  legalit not accepting 0 as legal fixed. Abbreviation code
	  modified to more efficient (copying off of Getopt::Long).

0.07  Tue Mar 14 10:02:45 EST 2000
	- legalit now uses qr if Perl version is 5.005 or above, and
	  abbreviation code only matches start of text. Minor improvements
	  to other code.

0.08  Wed Mar 15 13:05:21 EST 2000
	- Now have two seperate versions, one for 5.005 and above and one
	  for below; the first uses qr. Grr... I dislike using two seperate
	  files, but it seems the simplest way. Thanks to schinder@pobox.com
	  for reminding me that a simple "if ($] >= 5.005)" won't work.

0.09  Tue Apr 04 12:59:15 EDT 2000
	- Bugfix for uc/lc prompt type, fix PAUSE upload problem.

0.10  Tue Apr 04 14:22:00 EDT 2000
	- Further bugfix for PAUSE upload problem - PAUSE needs a .pm file
	  to get the version.

0.11  Sat Mar 09 04:02:33 EST 2002
	- This should have been done a lot earlier; the changes were
	  mailed to me by Matthew O. Persico (persicom@acedsl.com)
	  a while back... Sorry!

        - Removed 5.002/5.005 specific versions; the one section of
          differing functionality wasn't useful enough to justify
          maintaining two files.

        - Added 'menu' functionality.

        - Added '-n' and '+-n'.

        - $DEBUG is now a package global that can be set from outside
          the package in order to debug it.

        - Changed float regexps to the version in Perl Cookbook, page
          44.
